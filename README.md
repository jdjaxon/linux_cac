A project for consistently configuring Debian-based Linux distributions to work with
Common Access Cards (CACs). Currently, this process will not work with Firefox if it
is installed via `snap`. Before using this project, please review the
[Known Issues](#known-issues) section.

> [!note]
> This project has moved from using Cackey to OpenSC, which seems to be
> more stable. If you don't use Cackey as a dependency of anything else,
> I recommend running the following:
> ```
> sudo apt purge cackey
> ```

## Supported Configurations

Regardless of how similar two distributions may be, I will only list
distributions and versions here that I know have been tested with this method.
Since Ubuntu 22.04, Firefox will only work if you allow the script to remove the
`snap` version and reinstall the browser with `apt`.

| Distribution | Versions  | Browsers                  |
|    :-:       |    :-:    |       :-:                 |
| Debian       | 12.5      | Firefox ESR, Chrome, Edge |
| Mint         | 21.2      | Firefox, Chrome           |
| Parrot OS    | 6.0.0-2   | Firefox, Brave            |
| PopOS!       | 20.04 LTS | Firefox, Chrome           |
|              | 22.04 LTS | Firefox, Chrome           |
| Ubuntu       | 20.04 LTS | Firefox, Chrome           |
|              | 22.04 LTS | Firefox, Chrome           |

> [!note]
> There are reports of this script working with other distributions and
> browsers. I have not personally tested these configurations.


## Installation
> [!warning]
>  Please make sure all browsers are closed before running the script.

This script requires root privileges since it installs `opensc` package and
its dependencies. Feel free to review the script
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdjaxon/linux_cac/main/cac_setup.sh)
if this makes you uncomfortable. For transparency, the
the DoD certificates are downloaded from
[here](https://militarycac.com/maccerts/AllCerts.zip), which are
recommended by [militarycac](https://militarycac.com).

> [!note]
> - The automated installation requires `wget` and `unzip` to run and will
>  install both during the setup if they are not already installed. If you don't
>  want either tool, remove it after the setup is complete using `sudo apt remove <command>`.
> - The scripted installation has only been tested on the configurations listed in the
>  [Supported Configurations](#supported-configurations)


#### Methods
- `wget`
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdjaxon/linux_cac/main/cac_setup.sh -O -)"
```

- `curl`
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdjaxon/linux_cac/main/cac_setup.sh)"
```

- `fetch`
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(fetch -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdjaxon/linux_cac/main/cac_setup.sh)"
```

## Known Issues
- The `pkcs11-register` command sometimes does not behave as expected when run
  in a script. Users may need to reboot or run `pkcs11-register` upon the
  completion of this setup script.

- Firefox and Chrome both need to be started at least once to initialize their
  respective certificate databases/profiles.

- Ubuntu 21.10 and greater (to include the latest LTS 22.04) have Firefox
  installed via snap by default. There is an outstanding bug
  (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1734371) that prevents Firefox
  from being able to read the certificates. One solution could be to uninstall
  Firefox from snap and reinstall it via `apt`. This current version of the
  script will attempt to do the reinstallation for you.

- Recent DoD certificates do not work with Cackey and will cause errors like
  `ERR_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_NO_COMMON_ALGORITHMS`. You can simply rerun the script
  to resolve this.

- If you run into any issues with Firefox after running the script, clear your
  data and history in `Privacy & Security` and then restart Firefox. If your
  troubles are with MS Teams, see the section for [troubleshooting
  teams](#microsoft-teams). Chrome is recommended for MS Teams since Firefox
  does not currently support Teams meetings. You can see more about this
  [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/join-a-teams-meeting-on-an-unsupported-browser-daafdd3c-ac7a-4855-871b-9113bad15907).

- Firefox will likely start up a bit slower after running this installation.


## Troubleshooting
### Microsoft Teams
If you run into issues with MS Teams, try the following steps:
1. In the Firefox Settings window, select the `Privacy & Security` tab
2. Under `Cookies and Site Data`, select `Manage Exceptions`
3. In the `Address of website` text box, enter the following URLs, and then select `Allow`
    ```
    https://microsoft.com
    https://microsoftonline.com
    https://teams.skype.com
    https://teams.microsoft.com
    https://sfbassets.com
    https://skypeforbusiness.com
    ```
4. Select `Save Changes`

> [!note]
> `strict` security settings in Firefox may cause a loading loop
